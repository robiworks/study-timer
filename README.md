# Study Timer
A simple client-side study timer written in JavaScript and basic HTML and CSS for styling. Accessible on [https://robiworks.github.io/study-timer/](https://robiworks.github.io/study-timer/).

The timer has **60-minute study blocks** followed by **10-minute breaks**. When a study/break block ends, an alarm jingle plays and the timer starts counting down again.
